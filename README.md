## Description
Playing around with the common algo challenge of finding the first non-repeating character
in a given string while only traversing the string up to the point a non-repeating character is detected on the second pass

Iteration count is equal to the amount of characters until detection plus string length, or twice the string length if none found

## Common pitfalls
A big part of this kind of challenge is determining whether or not a developer is able to thoroughly examine the task before it is worked on.

It is all too easy to end up writing a function that returns the first non-*consecutive* character, which is a [wholly different function](https://jsfiddle.net/a1dmrt9o/)

## Algorithm
```javascript
/* Verbose version solving the common algo of finding the first non-repeating character */
const firstNonRepeatingCharacter = (string) => {
  
  // Init lookup object
  let object = {}
  
  // Pass through string once counting the character occurences
  for (index in string) {
    // Add 1 to the count, if character not counted before default the pre-count value as 0
    object[string[index]] = ( object[string[index]] || 0 ) + 1
  }

  // Second pass through the string, return the function as soon as a single count has been detected.
  // This relies on the fact that the object properties are sorted by order of insertion,
  // so the first occurence is therefore the first non-repeating character
  for (character in object) {
    if (object[character] === 1) return character
  }

  // If function did not return earlier, return false to indicate no non-repeating characters
  return false
}

/* Minified version solving the common algo of finding the first non-repeating character */
const u =(s)=>{let o={};for(i in s){o[s[i]]=(o[s[i]]||0)+1};for(c in o){if(o[c]===1)return c}return false}
```

## Example inputs and outputs
```javascript
"ssssdddKKKKjjjjwwww!wwwweskjdjfhkjwh" = "!"
```

```javascript
"aaassslllkjdoiqwjsdkjlqwe" = "o"
```

```javascript
"aaaaaaaaakkkkkkkkkkkkkkwwwwwwwwwwwjjÆÆøøåååå" = false
```

## Caveats
Object keys are sorted chronologically, but grouped depending on whether the string index is a number, a character or a symbol, respectively.
